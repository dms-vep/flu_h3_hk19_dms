# Generating primers at important H3 epitopes

This directory generates mutagenic primers with random codons at important epitope sites in H3. 

[data](https://github.com/jbloomlab/barcoded_H3_DMS/tree/main/library_design/major_epitope_primers/data) includes the following:

* A ranked list of important epitope positions, for identifying important positions within a primer length of one another. John Huddleston generated this analysis based on mutations that are present in multiple major clades over the past 6 years. The summary is written up in [ranked-list-of-epitope-positions-for-DMS-experiments.pdf`](https://github.com/jbloomlab/barcoded_H3_DMS/blob/main/library_design/targeted_primers/data/ranked-list-of-epitope-positions-for-DMS-experiments.pdf).

* `fasta` files for Kansas/14/2017 (GISAID accession #WSS2413637) and HongKong/45/2019 (GISAID accession #WSS2413591).

[results](https://github.com/jbloomlab/barcoded_H3_DMS/tree/main/library_design/major_epitope_primers/results) includes output files with single and double mutant primers for both Kansas/14/2017 and HongKong/45/2019.
