# Analysis of H3 amino acid preferences

This directory contains an initial analysis of H3 amino acid preferences for Perth09, based on DMS data 
generated by [Lee et al. (2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49324). Single mutants that are as 
deleterious as some quantile of stop codon effects are identified and output to a `.csv` file of deleterious 
mutants.

[data](https://github.com/jbloomlab/barcoded_H3_DMS/tree/main/library_design/initial_prefs_analysis/data): 
files listing the averaged amino acid preferences, in either sequential or H3 numbering. Analysis of DMS data 
and calculation of amino acid preferences by Lee et al. can be found in [this 
repository](https://github.com/jbloomlab/2017-Perth2009-DMS).

* `Perth09_avgprefs_all_H3numbering.txt` - averaged AA preferences in H3 numbering, copied from

[results](https://github.com/jbloomlab/barcoded_H3_DMS/tree/main/library_design/initial_prefs_analysis/results): 
a `.csv` file of single mutants that are as deleterious as 75% of stop codons.
