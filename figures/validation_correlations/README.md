# Correlation between DMS escape scores and traditional neutralization assays
This directory contains analysis of the correlation between DMS escape scores and the log-fold-change in IC50 measured by traditional GFP-based neutralization assays. See [neut_assays](../../neut_assays/) in the top-level directory for calculation of IC50 from neutralization data for selected mutations. These notebooks generate the correlation plots in figures 1, 3, 4, and S7.
