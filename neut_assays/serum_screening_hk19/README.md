# Screening sera for neutralization activity against A/HongKong/45/2019

[age_cohort_sera](age_cohort_sera) - screening 144 sera from defined age cohorts (0-5yo, 15-20yo, and 40-45yo) against HK/19. Includes analysis of 30 sera selected for DMS experiments.

[AUSAB_misc_sera](AUSAB_misc_sera) - final neut curves for 6 sera from Alex Greninger against HK/19 and the H6 neutralization standard. Includes sample 'AUSAB-13', also included in the H3 HA DMS paper.

[old_analyses](old_analyses) - misc. serum screening for samples not included in the final H3 HA DMS paper. 
* Initial screening of 16 sera from Alex Greninger, generated by Timothy Yu, Jan 2022. 
* Screening of monoclonal antibodies 5G01, 3B06, 1B02, 3G01, 1C04, and 5G04. Only 1C04 and 5G04 showed appreciable neutralization activity against HK/19.
