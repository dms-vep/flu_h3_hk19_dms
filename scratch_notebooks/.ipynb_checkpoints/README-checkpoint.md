# Scratch notebooks for rough analyses
This directory contains scratch notebooks used to run one-off analyses of different experimental results. Documentation of these notebooks is minimal, and all finalized analyses can be found in `../figures`, `../neut_assays`, or `../results`. 

* [220121-230119_analyses](220121-230119_analyses) - analysis of initial pilot selection experiments. These were all conducted using sera and mAbs *not* included in the final paper (with the exception of AUSAB-13). Includes troubleshooting of: 
    * library bottlenecking
    * amplification of 'invalid' barcodes
    * testing polyclonal modeling results for selections at different sets of serum concentrations
    * optimizing input library titers + volume in selections to avoid serum antibody saturation, and generate consistent results between libA and libB
* Analyses after 230301 all pertain to selections for sera from different age cohorts, used in the final paper. 
* [figure_drafts](figure_drafts) - full set of drafts for generation of paper figures. These are rough and have minimal documentation; finalized versions can be found in [../figures](../figures)
