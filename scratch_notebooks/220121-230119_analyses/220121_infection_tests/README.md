### 1-21-22: pilot library infections, no antibody
First round of infections, mainly testing for bottlenecking of library diversity during either infection or reverse transcription. Compared infections with different amounts of virus.
* [analyze_correlations.ipynb](analyze_correlations.ipynb) checks correlation between experimental replicates with and without high outliers. Also generates scatterplots comparing variant counts between replicates.
* [220121_correlations](220121_correlations) contains resulting scatterplots.
