# Invalid Barcode Troubleshooting
Analysis of barcodes that are highly represented in all sequenced library samples, but are **not** present in PacBio sequencing of full plasmid varaints.

- [search_barcodes_in_pacbio.ipynb](search_barcodes_in_pacbio.ipynb) searches for specific barcode sequences and their reverse complement in PacBio sequences.
- [compare_invalid_barcodes.ipynb](compare_invalid_barcodes.ipynb) characterizes rank and abundance of invalid barcodes across no-antibody infection, antibody selection, plasmid, and negative control barcode sequencing.
