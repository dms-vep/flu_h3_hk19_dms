# Summary Figures - May 16, 2022
Generating simple, pared-down visualizations to summarize results of library selections thus far.

- [libA_libB_sele_summary.ipynb](libA_libB_sele_summary.ipynb) generates most summary figures for results of A/HongKong/45/2019 mutagenic library selection by serum AUSAB-07. These selections were run against both libA and libB at increased serum concentrations. Also note that barcodes were prepped for sequencing using updated methods that eliminated both cross-sample contamination, and spurious barcode amplification in negative controls.
- [scratch_figs](scratch_figs/) contains all output figures from above notebook.
